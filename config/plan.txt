STATUS: Phase 6.1 COMPLETE, Phase 6.2 IN PROGRESS
Deliverable: A robust, fault-tolerant trading engine, a standardized backtesting framework with realistic costs, and an initial ensemble strategy.
Next: Enhance the ensemble with dynamic weighting and begin live paper trading validation.

================================================================================
PART 2: THE PLAN GOING FORWARD
================================================================================

PHASE 4: SIMPLESMA LIVE PAPER TRADING (CLOUD DEPLOYMENT) - COMPLETE
==================================================================
Goal: Verify system stability and extensibility.
Outcome: ✓ SUCCESS. The system ran stably and proved the architecture is robust.

PHASE 5: BUILD ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES & REFACTOR BACKTESTING - COMPLETE
========================================================================
Goal: Build a library of diverse strategies and standardize the backtesting process.
Outcome: ✓ SUCCESS. Four core strategies implemented and backtesting refactored.

PHASE 5.5: ADD SLIPPAGE & COMMISSIONS TO BACKTEST - COMPLETE
=============================================================
Goal: Make backtests realistic and comparable to paper/live results.
Outcome: ✓ SUCCESS. The `BacktestEngine` now models slippage and asset-specific commissions (zero for stocks, percentage for crypto), providing realistic post-cost performance metrics.

PHASE 5.6: DASHBOARD & ANALYTICS MONITOR - COMPLETE
=====================================================
Goal: Provide a consolidated overview of system performance.
Outcome: ✓ SUCCESS. A multi-strategy runner (`backtest_all_strategies.py`) automates backtesting for all strategies across multiple symbols, saving results to `strategy_comparison.csv`. A Jupyter notebook (`performance_dashboard.ipynb`) loads this data to visualize and compare performance.

PHASE 6: STRATEGY ENSEMBLE & VOTING (CLOUD DEPLOYMENT) - IN PROGRESS
=====================================================================
Goal: Combine multiple strategies for better robustness and deploy for paper trading.

Tasks:

6.1 Implement Voting System - ✓ COMPLETE
├── ✓ Moved ensemble to `src/strategies/strategy_ensemble.py`
├── ✓ Implemented `BaseStrategy` interface for compatibility
├── ✓ Implemented static majority voting (all 4 strategies included)
├── ✓ Refined with `min_votes` quorum (e.g., 2+) to filter low-conviction signals
└── ✓ Backtested ensemble vs. individual strategies across all symbols

6.2 Weighted Voting & Risk Management - NEXT
├── Implement weighted voting: allow weighting strategies by recent performance
│   └── Idea: Use metrics from `strategy_comparison.csv` to derive weights
├── Implement confidence scoring: only trade if vote margin exceeds a threshold
├── Add conflict filtering: explicitly hold if `buy` and `sell` votes are tied or conflicting
├── Track correlation between strategies to ensure diversification
└── Enforce max positions and daily loss limits at the ensemble level

6.3 Ensemble Validation & Deployment - LATER
├── Paper trade the best ensemble version (static or weighted) for 1+ month
├── Compare paper results against backtest results to validate performance
├── Ensure ensemble consistently outperforms the best individual strategy
└── Only proceed to real money if ensemble is demonstrably superior and stable

Timeline: 1-2 weeks
Deliverable: A validated ensemble strategy ready for final checks before real money.

PHASE 7: FINAL VALIDATION BEFORE REAL MONEY
=============================================
Goal: Final checks before deploying real money.

Tasks:
├── Risk Management Checklist: Verify stop losses, take profits, loss limits.
├── Performance Consistency: Ensure ensemble win rate > 40%, Sharpe > 0.5, Max DD < 20%.
├── Paper vs Backtest Alignment: Confirm paper returns are within 5-10% of backtest.
├── State Persistence & Recovery (NEW):
│   ├── Implement a `StateManager` to save/load open positions (e.g., to JSON).
│   ├── Ensure the `TradingEngine` can recover state after a restart.
│   └── Test clean restarts during active paper trades.

Timeline: 1 week
Deliverable: A restart-safe, fully validated trading engine.

PHASE 8: REAL MONEY DEPLOYMENT (START SMALL)
==============================================
Goal: Deploy ensemble to live trading with small capital.
Critical: Start with ONLY 5% of total capital.
Tasks:
├── Switch to live Alpaca API keys.
├── Start with a small position size ($1000-$5000).
├── Monitor daily: P&L, trades, drawdown.
├── Set up alerts for drawdown > 10% or daily loss > 2%.
└── Scale capital gradually over 3+ months if profitable.

Timeline: Ongoing
Deliverable: A live, profitable trading system.

PHASE 9: PERFORMANCE MONITORING & ALERTS
=========================================
Goal: Monitor live trading and detect issues early.
Tasks:
├── Set up real-time P&L tracking (via dashboard or reports).
├── Implement email/SMS notifications for risk alerts.
├── Persist all live trades and daily P&L snapshots to a database or log file.

PART 5: KEY INSIGHT - ARCHITECTURE FIRST, STRATEGY LATER
================================================================================

This project prioritizes:

1. SOLID FOUNDATION (Phases 1-5)
   ├── Architecture that scales
   ├── Risk management automated
   ├── Real-time execution proven
   ├── Standardized backtesting framework
   └── Extensible design

2. MULTIPLE STRATEGIES (Phases 5-6)
   ├── Don't depend on one signal
   ├── Validate each independently and comparatively
   ├── Combine via ensemble voting
   └── Diversified edge = safer

3. REALISTIC VALIDATION (Phase 5.5)
   ├── Backtest with real costs (slippage, commissions)
   ├── Paper trading 1+ month
   ├── Walk-forward testing
   └── Consistent results only

4. CONSERVATIVE DEPLOYMENT (Phase 8)
   ├── Start with 5% capital
   ├── Scale gradually
   ├── Continuous monitoring
   └── Never skip risk rules

Philosophy: Better to be slow and profitable than fast and broke.

PART 7: HOW TO ADD NEW STRATEGIES
================================================================================

Pattern for adding any new strategy:

Step 1: Create strategy file in `src/strategies/`
(e.g., `my_new_strategy.py`)

Step 2: Implement the `BaseStrategy` interface
(Define `__init__` and `evaluate_signal` method)

Step 3: Create a backtest runner script in `tests/backtest/`
- Import the new strategy and the `BacktestEngine`.
- Instantiate the engine with your strategy.
- Run `engine.run(symbol, days_back)` and analyze the `BacktestResult`.

Step 4: Add to the multi-strategy runner
- Add your new strategy to `tests/backtest/backtest_all_strategies.py` to compare its performance against the existing library.

Step 5: (Later) Paper trade it
- If performance is promising, add it to the live `TradingEngine` on the cloud server.

PART 9: WHAT'S NEXT (Phase 6.2)
================================================================================

Immediate next steps:

1. Enhance Ensemble with Weighted Voting
   - Modify `StrategyEnsemble` to accept a dictionary of weights.
   - Update the voting logic to use these weights instead of a simple vote count.
   - In the runner, derive weights from the `strategy_comparison.csv` (e.g., based on `return_pct` or win rate).

2. Backtest and Compare Ensemble Versions
   - Run the multi-strategy runner with both the static (equal weight) and weighted ensembles.
   - Use the dashboard to compare their performance side-by-side. The goal is to see if weighting improves returns or reduces drawdown.

3. Prepare for Live Paper Trading
   - Once the best ensemble version is identified, configure the live `TradingEngine` on the cloud server to use it.
   - Start the one-month validation period (Phase 6.3).

Timeline: Start immediately on weighted voting.

================================================================================
PART 10: NOTES FOR FUTURE CONTEXT WINDOWS
================================================================================

Quick Reference:

STATUS: Phase 6.1 COMPLETE / Phase 6.2 (Weighted Voting) IN PROGRESS.
- Core strategies (SMA, RSI, MACD, Mean Reversion) are built.
- Backtesting is standardized and includes realistic costs (slippage/commissions).
- A multi-strategy runner and analytics dashboard are complete and functional.
- A static, equal-weight `StrategyEnsemble` has been built, tested, and refined with a `min_votes` quorum to reduce noise.

NEXT: Phase 6.2 (NOW)
- Enhance the `StrategyEnsemble` to support weighted voting.
- Use performance data from backtests to create an initial set of weights.
- Compare the performance of the static vs. weighted ensemble.
- Prepare to deploy the best version for a one-month live paper trading validation run.

Key Files (Updated):
- Ensemble Strategy: `src/strategies/strategy_ensemble.py` (the current focus of development)
- Backtest Runner: `tests/backtest/backtest_all_strategies.py` (used to test all strategies, including the ensemble)
- Analytics: `notebooks/performance_dashboard.ipynb` (used to visualize and compare results)
